# BEST YAHTZEE EVER!!

## What is Yahtzee ? (also known as Yams because having two names is cooler :p)

The poker of dices ! That's what Yahtzee, or Yams for those in the know :p, is!
Instead of cards, you get 5 dices. Because 5 is a nice number, very friendly unlike 7 (because 6's afraid of 7, he's a cannibal :p).
Everything begins with the little number of 13. 
13 turns to win the cup, 13 turns with at least on time throwing your dices and at most 3.
13 turns to collect points and you know what ? You can combine the dices to get bonus points!!

Each time you throw your dices, you get further into this (really addictive) game (especially because we made it so well! :p).

But what is this combinations we were talking about you may ask (because you read really carefully this nice presentation, we know you do!)?

We will use the french names, because we like having a Oulala! effect in our game ;)!

First let me introduce to you to...

**Brelan**! 
Brelan is a nice combination that shows up when you get 3 identical dices (ex: 666 :D).
Annnd thanks to Brelan you get as extra points the addition of the 3 identical dices. 
Isn't that nice? Such a nice guy this Brelan!

Next is...

**Carré**! 
Carré is an even nicer combination, you can make a Carré if you have (wait for it...) 4 identical dices (didn't see that coming eh? XD).
As Carré is Brelan's brother, he is giving you extra point the same way, by addition of his 4 identical dices.
It not copying, they're brothers ok (that's a sensitive subject)?

Then we have...

**Full**!
Full is not a simple combination like the two others, but a combination of combinations (yep we've got a case of diception my friends)!
Full is a Brelan and a pair combination, or in other words 3 identical dices and 2 other identical dices (not 5 identical dices, that comes later, be patient ;)).
And because Full is a really nice combination of combination, he's getting you 25 points! Nice isn't it?

After all this you might think we've got enough combination? Buuuuut no, because Yahtzee likes you, there are even more of them!

Let me introduce you to...

**Petite Suite**!
Petite Suite is a cute little combination (because petite = little in french :p) you can invoke (like pokemons or demons, you're can choose the metaphor you like) when you have a sequence of 4 numbers with your dices (ex: 1,2,3,4).
If you get a Little Suite, you'll get 30 points!

Next is...

**Grande Suite**!
Grande Suite is the big sister of Petite Suite, and she also appears with sequence of numbers made with your dices. But because she's the big sister, you need 5 dices this time (ex: 1,2,3,4,5)!
Aaaaaaand if you get Grande Suite, you'll get 40 points!

Crazy isn't it! And we have still some for you!

Here comes...

**Yahtzee**!
Yahtzee (yes like the name of the game! Easy to remember right?), is what you get if you have 5, yes 5 identical dices (let's say it the king of Brelan and Carré :p).
That's a hard to get, but your efforts won't be for nothing. Yahtzee will get you... 50 points if you get him!

And FINALLY!
There is another way to gain points. It's not perse a combination, but it is still an important part of the game.
This one will let you get point each time, because she's the nicest of all (even if she doesn't get you as many point as the combinations).

It's time to get to know...

**Chance**!
Chance gives you the possibility to addition your dices, wether you have a combination or not. This way you still gets points.

That's a lot to process.
Why don't we make a recap ?
Let's go!

## How to start the game

All of this is nice, but how do we launch the 'BEST YAHTZEE EVER!!'?

First you need to use this command line in your terminal (don't be afraid, it can become your best friend of all time!):

`gcc main.cpp -o main`

This will create the main file that we will start next with:

`./main`

Annnnd now you can play by following the instructions. Easy peasy!
